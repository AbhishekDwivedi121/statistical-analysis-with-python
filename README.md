# üìä Statistics Project

## üßæ Description
This project covers fundamental and advanced topics in **statistical analysis** ‚Äî including **PDF, PMF, CDF**, and various **hypothesis testing methods** such as t-test, z-test, ANOVA, Chi-square, and F-test.  
The goal of this project is to perform statistical inference and hypothesis testing on data using Python.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Probability Distributions
- **PMF (Probability Mass Function)** ‚Äì Defines probabilities for discrete random variables.  
- **PDF (Probability Density Function)** ‚Äì Defines probability density for continuous random variables.  
- **CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)** ‚Äì Represents the cumulative probability up to a certain value.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing
A method to make inferences about populations using sample data.  

**Steps:**
1. Define null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) and alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)  
2. Choose significance level (Œ±)  
3. Calculate the test statistic  
4. Compute the p-value  
5. Make a decision (Reject or Fail to Reject H‚ÇÄ)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Confidence Interval (CI)
A range of values likely to contain the population parameter.  

**Formula (for mean):**
\[
CI = \bar{X} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\]

**Example:**  
‚ÄúThe population mean is estimated to lie between 48.2 and 52.6 with 95% confidence.‚Äù

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ t-Test
Used when the **population standard deviation is unknown**.  

**Types:**
- One-sample t-test  
- Independent two-sample t-test  
- Paired t-test  

**Use case:** Compare means of two small samples.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ z-Test
Used when the **population standard deviation is known** and **sample size > 30**.  

**Applications:**
- Test for population mean  
- Test for population proportion  

**Example:** Test if a coin is fair or biased.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Used to compare means across **three or more groups**.  

- **Null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** All group means are equal  
- **Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** At least one group mean is different  
- **Outputs:** F-statistic and p-value

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Chi-Square Test (œá¬≤)
Used for **categorical data** to test relationships or distribution fit.  

**Types:**
- Chi-square Goodness of Fit Test  
- Chi-square Test of Independence  

**Example:** Check if gender and product preference are independent.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ F-Test
Used to compare **two population variances**.  

**Formula:**
\[
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
\]

Commonly used as part of ANOVA.
